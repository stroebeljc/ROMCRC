<p>ZX81 BASIC and assembly program to calculate ROM CRC and identify version.</p>
<p>The output include two versions of the CRC16 algorithm. The first is often referred to as CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE or CRC-16/IBM-3740 while the second is CRC-16/XMODEM. See [Greg Cook's CRC Catalogue](https://reveng.sourceforge.io/crc-catalogue/16.htm)</p>
<p>Built using TASM 3.2.</p>
